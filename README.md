# Automated video analysis for dynamic systems

This is the MATLAB code for AVADS, which stands for Automated Video Analysis for Dynamic Systems. AVADS is a MATLAB user interface which allows you to automatically track markers throughout videos, create segments and joint angles in two-dimensions, and compute a variety of kinematic outcomes. While this program was designed to provide athletic trainers, clinicians, and physical therapists with a feasible method to objectively measure human movement, AVADS can also be useful for a wide variety of application. 

To run the code, download and save AVADS.m and AVADS.fig in the same location. 

For more information and guided tutorials with sample videos, please download the AVADS user manual and tutorial guide and watch this tutorial video: https://youtu.be/V1sRvobRI9k. 

This program was introduced the following manuscript. If you use this program, please cite this paper.

Note: we are actively working on translating AVADS to Java, where it can be run using ImageJ (FIJI), an open-source image/video analysis program. To download the stable version of AVADS_IJ, please visit this repository: https://github.com/GranataLab/AVADS_IJ.
