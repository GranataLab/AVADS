# Automated video analysis for dynamic systems

This is the MATLAB code for AVADS, which stands for Automated Video Analysis for Dynamic Systems. AVADS is a MATLAB user interface which allows you to automatically track markers throughout videos, create segments and joint angles in two-dimensions, and compute a variety of kinematic outcomes. While this program was designed to provide athletic trainers, clinicians, and physical therapists with a feasible method to objectively measure human movement, AVADS can also be useful for a wide variety of application. 

To run the code, download and save AVADS.m and AVADS.fig in the same location. 

For more information and guided tutorials with sample videos, please download the AVADS user manual and tutorial guide. 

This program was introduced the following manuscript. If you use this program, please cite this paper.

Note: AVADS.ijm, UR_R_Trimmed.mp4, and UR_R.xlsx are not associated/needed for the MATLAB version of AVADS. We are currently working on coding AVADS in JAVA so that it can be used with ImageJ.
